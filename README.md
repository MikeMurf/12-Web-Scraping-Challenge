The Web Scraping Homework required the use of the following components:
* Jupyter Notebook
* BeautifulSoup
* Pandas
* Requests/ Splinter 
* Python
* HTML
* Requests/ Splinter
* MongoDB
* Flask 
* Bootstrap

The basic steps of the homework are as follows:
1.	Complete the initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Requests / Splinter and store the results for use in Step 2.
2.	Use MongoDb to store the results from Step 1 and Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped re the Mission to Mars.

The “12_mission_to_mars” directory contains the following files submitted for assessment:
* “mission_to_mars” – the Jupyter Notebook,
*	“scrape” – the Python file which imports the scraping script and calls the “scrape_mars” subroutine,
*	“scrape_mars”” – the Python file which contains the subroutine that does the scraping in step 2,
*	“templates/index’ – the HTML template file which takes the mars data dictionary and displays it the appropriate HTML elements,
*	“Mars_scraping_screenshots” – screenshots of the final web page as initially rendered, after the “Scrape Updated Mars Data” is run, and as a responsive web page,
*	“MongoDB contents” – a Word document showing the MongoDB database components,
*	“scrape_mars_output” – a Word document showing the console output when “scrape” is run.

The files can be run from this directory.
